# github-search

Right now, this repository is just meant for me to learn React, slowly but surely. It's currently without any styling (like seriously, *none*), using jade as its view engine, and does almost nothing. You can probably ignore it. :)

If you insist on running it, though ...

    > git clone https://github.com/jdegner0129/github-search.git
    > cd github-search
    > npm install
    > gulp
    > npm start
